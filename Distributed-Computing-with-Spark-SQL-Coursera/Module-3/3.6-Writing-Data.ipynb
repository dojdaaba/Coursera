There are a number of variables that can be tweaked to optimize performance, largely relating to how data is organized on the cluster. Partitions are the first step in understanding performant database connections.\n\n**A partition is a portion of your total data set,** which is divided into many of these portions so Spark can distribute your work across a cluster. \n\nThe other concept needed to understand Spark's computation is a slot (also known as a core). **A slot/core is a resource available for the execution of computation in parallel.** In brief, a partition refers to the distribution of data while a slot refers to the distribution of computation.\n\n<div><img src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/images/eLearning/ETL-Part-2/partitions-and-cores.png\" style=\"height: 400px; margin: 20px\"/></div>\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the number of partitions should be a multiple of the number of cores.
